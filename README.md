## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
The app was originally written for learning purposes for #dev-challenge-compose. It's a simple master-detail concept following modern android development ([MAD Scorecard](https://madscorecard.withgoogle.com/scorecard/share/4100143987/)).

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->

Some key facts about th app:
- It's in Kotlin, because everyone loves Kotlin
- It uses [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - of course! Say farewell to `xml` layouts. This includes dependencies for navigation, live data, material and others. 
- It's built with AndroidX architecture components and navigation component (tied to compose). Taking benefits of view models it's a simple MVVM - just one view model - nothing crazy. 
- It utilizes beauty of [Gradle version catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html)...
- ... along with Ben Manes [Gradle version plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin) wih simple setup to skip alpha versions, if there is a stable one used.
